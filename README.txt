We implemented three methods for image inpainting. Each folder in this repo contains the code, scripts to run the code, and data for one of the methods.

1. Folder "deep inpainting" corresponds to neural network method.

2. Folder "exemplar-based" is for the algorithm based on the paper "Region Filling and Object Removal by Exemplar-Based Image Inpainting" by Criminisi et. al. 

3. Folder "statisticalPatchOffset" contains the method that utilizes statiscal patch offset. This is another exemplar-based method.
